Given a matrix of size N x M . You have to find the kth element which will obtain while traversing the matrix spirally.
Input:
The first line of input is the no of test cases then T test cases follow . The first line of each test case has three integers n(rows), m(columns) and k . Then in the next line are n*m space separated values of the matrix A [ ] [ ] .
Output:
For each test case print spirally obtained kth element .
Your Task:
Since this is a functional problem you do need to take input just complete the function findK which accepts four parameters. The first parameter is the matrix A and the next two parameters are  n and m denoting the size of the matrix A . The fourth parameter is an integer  k denoting the kth element . The function will return the kth element obtained while traversing the matrix spirally.
Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=n,m<=20
1<=k<=n*m
Example:
Input
2
3 3 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
2 2 2
1 2 3 4
Output
6
2
Explanation
The matrix above will look like 
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
and the 4th element in spiral fashion will be 6 .
