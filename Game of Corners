Amy, Bob, Charlie and Dylan are stuck together in quarantine. They are childhood friends and are playing old games to pass the time. Help them find valid corners in the house to play the game of corners. 
Their house is represented by a N x M binary matrix consisting of 0s and 1s. Here each 1 represents a corner. 
Find if there exists a rectangle/ square within the matrix whose all four corners are 1. 

Input: 
The first line of input will be the number of testcases T, then T test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains R which denotes the number of rows. The second line of each testcase contains C which denotes the number of columns. The next line contains the NxM inputs of the matrix separated by space.

Output: 
Print "Yes" if there exists a rectangle/ square within the matrix whose all four corners are 1; else print "No".

User Task:
Complete the function ValidCorners that takes the given matrix as input and returns a boolean value.

Constraints:
1 <= R, C <= 200
0 <= A[i] <= 1


Example:
Input :
2
4
5
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 
3
3
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 

Output :
Yes
No

Explanation :
Testcase 1 : Given matrix looks like this
1 0 0 1 0 
0 0 1 0 1 
0 0 0 1 0 
1 0 1 0 1 
Valid corners are at index (1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4)
